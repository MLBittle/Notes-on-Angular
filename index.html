# Video 2 What Is Angular?
Angular is a JavaScript Framework that allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPAs).
It's one HTML file and a bunch of code from the server. Everything is rendered in the browser.
Everything happens instantly. 
JavaScript changes the DOM of that one page. 

# Angular vs Angular 2 vs Latest Version
Angular JS different version, works differently, 
2016 - Angular 2 with new framework.
Versions 4 up to 15 are on the same framework. New release every 6 months. Minor changes each time. Stable program.
Can ignore the versions.

Installing all the software in the terminal of VS Code. Node JS works behind the scenes and the npm is required to make things work.

# Video 5 Working in VS Code
This is the most frustrating thing ever! Office Hours and Code Coach Mike saved the day!
I'm up and working on my first App, but there's a lot to learn. 
I had a very frustrating time with this first try at Angular, I took advantage of Office Hours twice, and I learned a lot. But I am not confident that I can do the next one easily.
